Can't have spaghetti without spaghetti sauce.

## Compiling

Ensure you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) installed.

Then, run the following command in the project root to download all dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Afterwards, you can start the application host by running the following:

```shell
npm run dev
```

This starts a local web server. To use the application, simply open a browser and head to <http://localhost:3000>.

Alternatively, you can make a static build and host it on your own web server, but we won't cover that here because that's a lot to cover lol.
